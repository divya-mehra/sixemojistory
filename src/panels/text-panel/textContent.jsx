          By 1995, the pager was a Japanese sensation amongst teenagers. Carrier
          NTT Docomo sold its{" "}

            Pocket Bell pagers with ❤️ symbols
          </span>{" "}
          The heart is the most cited symbol, but records also say it had
          numeric codes that would send short pre-programmed messages with
          illustrations, like “I won’t forgive you” with a crying face.
          Interestingly, this was part of the “girls’ model” while the boys
          counterpart came with "I'm sorry,"{" "}

            as reported by the International Herald Tribune.

        </p>
        <p>
          When they removed the symbol a few years later, sales declined.
          Employee Shigetaka Kurita, who was working on Docomo’s mobile internet
          platform at the time, took notice and the company tasked him with
          adding emojis to the carrier’s set of characters. Limited to 12x12
          pixels, he{" "}
          <span className={styles.hoverText}>drew out 176 symbols</span> on
          paper and handed them over to the developer. Some of his decisions
          were based on observations of human behavior, others on personal
          preference. He likes to ski. So, he made a symbol for a big car that
          could hold his skis.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Why ❤️ is important</b>: Rumor has it that without the popularity
          of the heart symbol, Docomo wouldn't have caught on to the promise of
          the emoji on mobile devices.

          A little over 10 years later, Google joined forces with Japanese
          telecom carrier, KDDI AU, to create an emoji set for Gmail. They
          called it Project Mojo. (This was before the time of the Unicode
          Consortium, now overlord of emoji standardization.)

          One big point of contention was the poo emoji. The symbol became
          popular in Japan through{" "}

          But some people in Silicon Valley thought the it was offensive. What
          would people think of them if they added a pile of steaming shit (and
          that too, a smiling one!) to their vetted vocabulary? Japnese project
          manager, Takeshi Kishimoto was adamant: the emoji is essential. It
          says “’I don’t like that,’ but softly,” bringing an air of lighteness.
          It expresses a bad day with a laugh, standing in for the body language
          we lack in online communication. The team fought for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          They won, poo won, humanity won. This may sound like a joke, but what
          is raw humanity if not dealing with your shit on a daily basis?

          In 2013, a DoSomething campaign called Diversify My Emoji showed up
          online, stating the obvious: "If you look at Apple's Emoji keyboard,
          what do you see? Two different camels. A smiling turd. EVERY PHASE OF
          THE MOON. But of the more than 800 Emojis, the only two resembling
          people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a
          turban."
        </p>
        <p>In this world, a smiling turd can only go so far. </p>
        <p>
          Two years after the campaign appeared, the Unicode Consortium finally
          added five skin tone modifiers to the “standard” yellow. The colors
          came from something called the Fitzpatrick scale, chosen for its
          so-called neutrality derived from its medical origins – but is
          anything <i>really </i> neutral?
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the modifiers were out, not everyone chose to use them. The
          Atlantic even published an article,{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/white-people-dont-use-white-emoji/481695/"

          So did many others until the people laughed and said, stop talking
          about emoji (too late). Regardless of race, the question remains: do I
          want to draw attention to the color of my skin in every message I send
          out?

          Not many pop stars can claim to be synonymous with their own emoji.
          Beyonce runs with two: 🐝, for queen bey, and 🍋, which surged in
          popularity during the tour for her album, Lemonade. Use of the emoji
          notably spiked in 2016. The most unusual of these spikes was on
          celebrity chef Rachael Ray’s Instagram profile.{" "}

        <p>
          Some key context: Lemonade included a song called <i>Sorry</i>, ending
          in the line, "He better call Becky with the good hair.” The singer’s
          fans, aka the beehive, identified Becky as a woman with whom Jay-Z had
          an affair, and believed this person to be fashion designer Rachel Roy.{" "}

        <p>
          But the internet isn’t a place for thoughtfully considered comments
          and the beehive mistakenly unleashed itself on the innocent Rachael
          Ray, whose name rings similar to Rachel Roy. What followed was a
          string of cryptic emoji on a{" "}

          <b>Why 🐝🍋 is important</b>: Emoji are complex characters, and in
          combination with words, its potential meanings multiply. Imagine
          seeing a flurry of lemons and bees on a dinner recipe that does not
          involve citrus nor honey. The subtext lives large, especially online
          and out of context.

          When Kurita created his first set of emojis, he probably didn’t
          anticipate 3,664 pictorial variations coming into being. Now judges
          have to decide: in any given context, how much significance does the
          emoji hold? <i>Is</i> it a joke or does the cute little symbol bear a
          relation to concrete, potentially life-threatening, actions?{" "}

          In 2016, there were several cases involving the pistol emoji. A
          Frenchman went to jail for texting his ex-girlfriend the symbol, which
          the court called a real threat. The year prior, a teenager was charged
          for posting 👮‍♂️🔫 and another high school student for posting “meet me
          in the Library Tuesday,” followed by 🔫 🔪 💣. (Interestingly, in a

          Other platforms followed, the last being Facebook. Some may ask: well,
          why do we still have a bomb? Two hypotheses: 1) the bomb is a more
          stylized version of the real thing, and 2) a bomb can be used to say
          something is bomb. Again, the language of emoji adapts to our cultural
          vernacular.

          <b>Why 🔫 is important</b>: Just as emoji are added, they are also

          Emoji may the language of cuteness, but it becomes less cute when
          thousands of dollars are at stake. Last month, Canadian farmer Chris
          Achter responded to a contract confirmation with: 👍. His buyer later
          sued Achter for failing to deliver the goods and the judge ruled that
          👍 was just as good as a signature, ordering Achter to pay up $61,442
          USD.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meaning behind the innocuous little symbols have been incresingly
          put to the test ever since 2004 (as emoticons) and 2014 (as emoji).
          Just before the ruling on SWT v Achter, former Chewy CEO Ryan Cohen
          was sued by the SEC for tweeting "At least her cart is full 🌝" in
          response to negative press on Bed Bath & Beyond, and earlier this
          year, a Kentucky judge faced a decision of whether 💦 in a text
          referred to sexual acts or meth.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this begs the question we've been asking all along: Do emoji
          clarify or obscure? They conflate, confuse, or clarify. Their meaning
          multiples tenfold. And while our alphabet is finite (though
          vocabulary, and certainly, language is not), emoji continue to
          reproduce.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Why 👍 is important</b>: The recent court cases serve as a reminder
          that in front of the law, emoji may hold the same weight as a
          signature.
