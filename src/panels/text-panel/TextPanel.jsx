          practice of using ASCII characters to create pictures (the first
          suggestion of using :-) to indicate humor is said to have come from
          Scott Fahlman). The word emoji actually comes from the Japanese

          The meaning behind the innocuous little symbols have been incresingly
          put to the test ever since 2004 (as emoticons) and 2014 (as emoji).

          was sued by the SEC for tweeting "At least her cart is full üåù" in
          response to negative press on Bed Bath & Beyond, and earlier this
          year, a Kentucky judge faced a decision of whether üí¶ in a text
