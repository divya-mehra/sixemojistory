            In 2013, a DoSomething campaign called Diversify My Emoji showed up
            online, stating the obvious: "If you look at Apple's Emoji keyboard,
            what do you see? Two different camels. A smiling turd. EVERY PHASE
            OF THE MOON. But of the more than 800 Emojis, the only two
            resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and
            another in a turban." In this world, a smiling turd can only go so
            far.
          </p>

          <p>
            Two years after the campaign appeared, the Unicode Consortium
            finally added five skin tone modifiers to the ‚Äústandard‚Äù yellow. The
            colors came from something called the Fitzpatrick scale, chosen for
            its so-called neutrality derived from its medical origins ‚Äì but is
            anything <i>really </i> neutral?
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the modifiers were out, not everyone chose to use them. The
            Atlantic even published an article,{" "}

            Emoji may the language of cuteness, but it becomes less cute when
            thousands of dollars are at stake. Last month, Canadian farmer Chris
            Achter responded to a contract confirmation with: üëç. His buyer
            later sued Achter for failing to deliver the goods and the judge
            ruled that üëç was just as good as a signature, ordering Achter to

            The meaning behind the innocuous little symbols have been
            incresingly put to the test ever since 2004 (as emoticons) and 2014
            (as emoji). Just before the ruling on SWT v Achter, former Chewy CEO
            Ryan Cohen was sued by the SEC for tweeting "At least her cart is
            full üåù" in response to negative press on Bed Bath & Beyond, and
            earlier this year, a Kentucky judge faced a decision of whether üí¶
            in a text referred to sexual acts or meth.

          <p>
            All this begs the question we've been asking all along: Do emoji
            clarify or obscure? They conflate, confuse, or clarify. Their
            meaning multiples tenfold. And while our alphabet is finite (though
            vocabulary, and certainly, language is not), emoji continue to
