          mobile internet platform at the time, took notice.{" "}

          There‚Äôs a misconception that the word emoji comes from emoticon, the
          practice of using ASCII characters to create pictures (the first
          suggestion of using :-) to indicate humor is said to have come from
          Scott Fahlman). The word emoji actually comes from the Japanese
          characters for picture (Áµµ, e), write(Êñá, mo), and character (Â≠ó, ji).

        <p>
          <b>Why ‚ù§Ô∏è is important</b>: Rumor has it that without the popularity
          of the heart symbol, DoCoMo wouldn't have caught on to the promise of
          the emoji on mobile devices.

          Incorporating emoji into Gmail became the goal of Project Mojo at
          Google in 2007. The tech behemoth partnered with Japanese telecom
          carrier, KDDI AU, to create an emoji set for Gmail. (It would still be
          1 year before Apple released its emoji keyboard in Japan, and 2 before
          the Unicode Consortium was formed.)

          One point of contention was the poo emoji. The symbol became popular

           But some at Silicon Valley HQ thought the emoji was offensive. What
          would people think of them if they added a pile of steaming shit to
          their vocabulary?

          Emoji may the language of cuteness, but it becomes less cute when
          thousands of dollars are at stake. Last month, Canadian farmer Chris
          Achter responded to a contract confirmation with: üëç. His buyer later
          sued Achter for failing to deliver the goods and the judge ruled that
          üëç was just as good as a signature, ordering Achter to pay up $61,442
          USD.

          The meaning behind the innocuous little symbols have been incresingly
          put to the test ever since 2004 (as emoticons) and 2014 (as emoji).
          Just before the ruling on SWT v Achter, former Chewy CEO Ryan Cohen
          was sued by the SEC for tweeting "At least her cart is full üåù" in
          response to negative press on Bed Bath & Beyond, and earlier this
          year, a Kentucky judge faced a decision of whether üí¶ in a text
          referred to sexual acts or meth.

          All this begs the question: <br></br>
          <b>Do emoji clarify (as Fahlman initially intended), or obscure?</b>
          They conflate, confuse, or clarify. Their meaning multiples tenfold.
          And while our alphabet is finite (though vocabulary, and certainly,
          language is not), emoji continue to reproduce.
